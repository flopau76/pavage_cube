This is a mathematical optimisation project.
It tries to solve the following problem: is it possible to create a cube with a certain amount of pieces of a specific form.

To run an ampl simulation, execute any of the files in the folder `run`. 
New files will be created in the folder res_auto/ and log_auto/ but you first have to create this folder.

You can visualise the results with draw.py

The folder `miscellaneous` contains the following:
    - a python code `precompute_R.py` and the generated file `R.dat` with the precomputed matrices
    - an easy modelling without rotation
    - a python script `heat_modelisation.py` trying to solve the problem in an other way
